Hina Tsurugi has just moved to the country town of Ashiya, and she's eager to make new friends and indulge her favorite hobby: Crafting. Her plans take a turn for the briny, however, when she tries to rescue a local student from fainting on the docks, only to discover a passionate fisher preparing her morning catch. This is Kuroiwa, the older sister of Hina's childhood friend Natsumi, and she thinks a craft-capable girl like Hina would be the perfect fit for Umino High's Breakwater Club, which specializes in the arts of bait and tackle. There's just one problem: Hina is terrified of all manner of critter and sea-dweller, and has absolutely no interest in a fishing club. Kuroiwa and her friends aren't the type to give up on recruiting a new member, though, so Hina may just have to learn to find her inner fisherwoman and embrace a brand new hobby!
